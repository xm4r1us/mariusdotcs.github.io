My personal website that does not uses a framework or library. My old website was too bad so this is the rewritten version.

## Customizing

If you want to fork my website and add your discord profile, You can do this easily. Fork the website and open `./static/js/socket.js` file. Replace all `866849747603816468` with your Discord ID. Don't forget to join Lanyard server before doing this.
